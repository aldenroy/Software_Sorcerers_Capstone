# Retrospective: Sprint 1

## What Went Well
- Good progress
- Good amount of meetings
- Solid communication
- Most user stories accepted

## What Went Wrong
- Lack of testing completed

## What Did We Learn
- Prioritize testing more

## How Everyone's Feeling
- **Brady:** Good
- **Kira:** Good, *Identity is fun/interesting*
- **Alden:** Good
- **Kaitlyn:** Good, but the user story may be bigger than expected

# Future Notes
- **Search Bar Improvement:**  
  Eventually adjust the search bar to be separate from filter/sort to improve mobile/small screen visibility (similar to Amazon's search filter layout).

- **Peer Testing:**  
  Conduct peer testing before sprint review with Chris.
  
- **Dashboard Navigation:**  
  Create a future user story to add a navigation bar link for the Dashboard that should only display when a user is logged in (Identity? Kira to look into how to implement this).
